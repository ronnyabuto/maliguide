> AI-Powered Investment Intelligence for Kenyan Markets with Real-time Sentiment Analysis

## What is MaliGuide?

MaliGuide is a cutting-edge financial technology platform that democratizes investment intelligence for the Kenyan market. By combining artificial intelligence, real-time market data, and advanced sentiment analysis, we provide retail and institutional investors with the tools traditionally available only to large financial institutions.

Our platform specializes in the unique dynamics of Kenyan financial markets, offering comprehensive coverage of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) securities, Money Market Funds, cryptocurrency markets, and forex rates - all through an intuitive, AI-powered interface.

*"Mali" means wealth in Swahili - MaliGuide is your guide to building wealth through smart investing.*
